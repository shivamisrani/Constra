## Changelog

### v6.3.4 (latest)

**Release Date:** 18th July 2024

* **Security Fix** - The ACF shortcode now prevents access to fields from different private posts by default. View the [release notes](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-6-3-4) for more information
* **Fix** - Users without the `edit_posts` capability but with custom capabilities for editing a custom post type can now correctly load field groups loaded via conditional location rules
* **Fix** - Block validation no longer validates a fieldâ€™s sub-fields on page load, only on edit. This resolves inconsistent validation errors on page load or when first adding a block
* **Fix** - Deactivating an ACF PRO license will now remove the license key even if the server call fails
* **Fix** - Field types returning objects no longer cause PHP warnings and errors when output via `the_field`, `the_sub_field`, or the ACF shortcode, or when retrieved by a `get_` function with the escape html parameter set
* **Fix** - Server-side errors during block rendering now gracefully display an error to the editor
